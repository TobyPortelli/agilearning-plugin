# AgiLearning Plugin

## Overview
This project is a React plugin designed to add gamification elements to an LMS. The plugin includes features such as points, achievements, and leaderboards to enhance student engagement and motivation, while allowing instructional designers to tailor these elements for different courses.

## Features
So far, this project is building towards having an XP tracker for students, achievements for students to earn as they complete tasks, and a user page that will be added to an LMS that uses our plugin, which will display a student's info along with different tracking of their progress, experience, achievements, and current level.

Beyond this, our plugin will also include a quiz/game portion where students can take quizzes and play games in order to gain experience and engage with content.

## Dependencies
This project utilizes React, Vite, and Hookstate.

## How to run this app
